Business banking bata sharing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under Australia's Consumer Data Right (CDR) regime, sharing business banking data (for entities
like Sole Traders, Partnerships, Companies, and Trusts) requires an explicit **opt-in**.
Consequently, setting up a business account with Basiq may require additional configuration steps
compared to a standard personal account. For detailed setup instructions, refer to Basiq's
`online documentation <https://api.basiq.io/docs/connecting-business-accounts-via-cdr>`_.
